## How to use this portfolio?
This portfolio contains selected projects that I like and found interesting or showcases particular skills that I have developed. Each project will be contained within a folder and in that folder, you will find a few files. One file will be "Lessons Learned" which will follow a similar format to an IR document during the Post-Incident phase. The other file(s) will be pdfs containing the goal, steps taken, outcome, and the tools/techniques used. If you are new to the industry and learning, feel free to follow along with my projects. If you are an industry veteran, feel free to point out anyways I can improve on the skills. Finally, if you are a recruiter/hirer check out my skills and consider me for a position. Thanks for stopping by.
